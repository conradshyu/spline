^ Synopsis
This archive contains the implementation of cubic spline interpolating polynomial for estimates of free energy
differences using thermodynamic integration. It also contains an example data file to jumpstart the use of
software. The implementation makes heavy use of STL (standard template library) which requires a C++ compiler.
This program is self-contained and should not require any additional libraries.

To compile the program, simply type:

`make`

The make program will invoke the Makefile and compiles the source code. Alternatively, to compile the files
manually, issue the command:

`g++ -I. driver.cpp spline.cpp -o spline -lm`

The archive lists three implementation files and an example file.

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `driver.cpp` | the user interface program |
| `spline.cpp`  | main implementation of cubic spline interpolation polynomial |
| `spline.h` | the header file for cubic spline interpolation polynomial |
| `example.csv` | example file of simulations data from thermodynamic integration |
| `Makefile` | the makefile to compile the source code |
| `README.md` | this file |

The purpose of the program is to construct a series of third degree polynomials (cubic spline functions) that
optimally fits the thermodynamic integration data. The implementation also contains an estimate function that
allows the interpolating polynomial be used to extrapolate points. This feature may be useful to determine the
accuracy of the interpolating polynomials.

The spline interpolation program takes three command-line parameters: `input_file`, `plot_file` (optional), and
`data_points` (optional). The followings detail the format and meaning of each command-line parameter.

## `input_file`
The input file must be saved in the plain text format. The first column contains the lambda values and second the
ensemble averages from the simulations. Each column of data must be separated by either a comma or a white space.
For example, followings list the contents of the example input file:

```
0.0,  51.49866347
0.1,  23.92508775
0.2,  10.35390700
0.3,   2.58426990
0.4,  -2.18351656
0.5,  -5.41745387
0.6,  -7.62452181
0.7,  -9.25455804
0.8, -10.45592989
0.9, -11.39244138
1.0, -12.12433704
```

To run the analysis program with only the required parameter, type:

`spline example.csv`

The program will output a series of third degree polynomials and the estimates of free energy using the spline and
trapezoidal rule. For example, the example file should generate the following output:

```

Free energy difference
Cubic Spline: 0.76994786
   Trapezoid: 1.02220063
```

The output lists piecewise polynomials for each interval. The second column lists the coefficients of the constant
term (X<sup>0</sup>), third the first degree (X<sup>1</sup>), forth the second degree (X<sup>2</sup>), and finally
fifth the third degree (X<sup>3</sup>).

## `plot_file`
This parameter specifies the name of the file that contains the estimates obtained from the piecewise polynomials.
This parameter is optional. If this parameter is not given, no plot data will be generated by the program. For
example, to generate a file of plot data with the default number of data points extrapolated from the piecewise
polynomials, issue the command:

`spline example.csv plot.csv`

The file, example.csv, is the input file that contains the thermodynamic integration data. The file, `plot.csv`,
is the output file that contains the estimates from the piecewise polynomials.

## `data_points`
This parameter specifies the number of data points extrapolated from the piecewise polynomials. This parameter is
optional. If this parameter is not given, the number of data points will be the same as the input file. For
example, to generate a file of plot data with 100 data points extrapolated from the piecewise polynomials, issue
the command:

`spline example.csv plot.csv 100`
